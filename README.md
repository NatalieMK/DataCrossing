# DataCrossing
A fan-made passion project. iOS app designed to keep track of data mined from Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

DataCrossing is a project I created over the past month as a way to track the vast amount of data provided by dataminers - in particular, credit goes to Ninji for providing the data DataCrossing uses.
Additionally, I've added this to my public repository as a representation to recruiters of what I am capable of. Unless otherwise noted, all code was written by me. 
DataCrossing also uses opensource code, and any bridging code I added in order to use it in-app is labelled as such. 

## Dependencies
Kingfisher (https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)
SwiftCSV (https://github.com/swiftcsv/SwiftCSV)

## Animal Crossing Resources 
Data Spreadsheet for Animal Crossing: New Horizons (https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet)
MeteoNook (https://github.com/Treeki/MeteoNook)

README in progress. 

As I am working alone on a local machine, this may not be the most recent version of DataCrossing. I still have more to implement. If you're curious in the project in regards to a job opportunity,
I can answer any questions through email or interview.

If you're an Animal Crossing fan, please feel free to use this as you wish! I've made some basic bridging headers and functions to connect DataCrossing to the open-source code for MeteoNook, which was written in Rust.

CSVs are formatted from the spreadsheet at https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet. I've reformatted them heavily for what I needed in this project, but they are all derivative of this spreadsheet, which saved me a LOT of time collecting and typing information about the
various critters in-game (80 fish, 80 bugs, and 40 different deep-sea creatures!).
